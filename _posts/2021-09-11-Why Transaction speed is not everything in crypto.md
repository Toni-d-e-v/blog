## What are normal transaction speeds for crypto

These days new crypto projects are rated by TPS or Transaction per second, every crypto is compared to the visa net with can handle about 65k tx/s but normally it handles about 7k tp/s. 
Bitcoin can handle about 7 tx per second, Ethereum about 50-65 but new cryptos like Solana can handle 50k tp/s
## Why transaction speeds are not everything
Blocks are chunks that contain data and transactions.
Bitcoin can handle a low amount of transactions because of PoW and the small block size.
Bitcoin block size is 1MB and bitcoins blockchain size is about 300 GB.

Solana on the other hand is 2TB in blockchain size and it's growing very fast!
We can make blockchains that can handle 1000 million transactions but you would need to have a data farm to host a node.
Transaction speed is not limited by technology but by hardware.

## How can we achieve scalable crypto

Most new sharding models come with a mechanism where blockchain is split between let's say 
64 shards and shards and shards are backed by 128 validators, but they cant talk between each other. Biggest problem with this solution is that network needs second layer solution to communicate with nodes on other shards.

This is where Redstone comes in, Redstone instead of dividing one blockchain into shards divides the whole network into sub-chains and nodes can communicate with each other without needing 2nd layers solutions.
