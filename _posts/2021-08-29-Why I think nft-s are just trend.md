## Why.
A non-fungible token new trend that acquired from having erc 721 coins with pictures, I think that people are making stupid NFT-s that are just waste on the blockchain and trying to sell only a few people succeed and sold there NFT-s for much. No, you won't sell ms paint pictures for 420 ethereums. 

## What are people using blockchain for?
People are using blockchain for stupid NFT marketplaces thinking they will be rich overnight, people are using it to build stupid tokens on the blockchain (Shiba, Safemoon). ICO scams without any project. Because of that people like me with legimited projects that are worth something cant break into the market.

## For that people should be using blockchain.

People should be using blockchain for new interesting ideas like Decentralize Exchange
.cryoto websites compound.
